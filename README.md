## Instructions

<details>
 <summary>Requirements</summary>

+ [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
+ [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) for creating the SSL cert.

Install mkcert:

```
brew install mkcert
brew install nss # if you use Firefox
```

 <summary>Setup</summary>

 ### Setup Environment variables

Both step 1. and 2. below are required:

#### 1. For Docker and the CLI script (Required step)

Copy `.env.example` in the project root to `.env` and edit your preferences.

Example:

```dotenv
IP=127.0.0.1
APP_NAME=myapp
DOMAIN="myapp.local"
DB_HOST=mysql
DB_NAME=myapp
DB_ROOT_PASSWORD=password
DB_TABLE_PREFIX=wp_
```
</details>

<details>
 <summary>Option 1). Use HTTPS with a custom domain</summary>

1. Create a SSL cert:

```shell
cd cli
./create-cert.sh
```

This script will create a locally-trusted development certificates. It requires no configuration.

> mkcert needs to be installed like described in Requirements. Read more for [Windows](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert#windows) and [Linux](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert#linux)

1b. Make sure your `/etc/hosts` file has a record for used domains.

```
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

Add your selected domain like this:

```
127.0.0.1 myapp.local
```

2. Continue on the Install step below

</details>

<details>
 <summary>Option 2). Use a simple config</summary>

1. Edit `nginx/default.conf.conf` to use this simpler config (without using a cert and HTTPS)

```shell
server {
    listen 80;

    root /var/www/html/web;
    index index.php;

    access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;

    client_max_body_size 100M;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        try_files $uri =404;
        fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
        fastcgi_pass wordpress:9000;
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        include fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info;
    }
}

```

2. Edit the nginx service in `docker-compose.yml` to use port 80. 443 is not needed now.

```shell
  nginx:
    image: nginx:latest
    container_name: ${APP_NAME}-nginx
    ports:
      - '80:80'

```

3. Continue on the Install step below

</details>

<details>
 <summary>Run</summary>

```shell
docker-compose up
```

Docker Compose will now start all the services for you:

```shell
Starting myapp-mysql    ... done
Starting myapp-composer ... done
Starting myapp-phpmyadmin ... done
Starting myapp-wordpress  ... done
Starting myapp-nginx      ... done
Starting myapp-mailhog    ... done
```

🚀 Open [https://myapp.local](https://myapp.local) in your browser

## PhpMyAdmin

PhpMyAdmin comes installed as a service in docker-compose.

🚀 Open [http://127.0.0.1:8082/](http://127.0.0.1:8082/) in your browser

## MailHog

MailHog comes installed as a service in docker-compose.

🚀 Open [http://0.0.0.0:8025/](http://0.0.0.0:8025/) in your browser

 <summary>Tools</summary>

### Update WordPress Core and Composer packages (plugins/themes)

```shell
docker-compose run composer update
```

#### Use WP-CLI

```shell
docker exec -it myapp-wordpress bash
```

Login to the container

```shell
wp search-replace https://olddomain.com https://newdomain.com --allow-root
```

Run a wp-cli command

> You can use this command first after you've installed WordPress using Composer as the example above.

### Update plugins and themes from wp-admin?

You can, but I recommend to use Composer for this only. But to enable this edit `./src/config/environments/development.php` (for example to use it in Dev)

```shell
Config::define('DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT', false);
Config::define('DISALLOW_FILE_MODS', false);
```

### Useful Docker Commands

When making changes to the Dockerfile, use:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --force-recreate --build
```

Login to the docker container

```shell
docker exec -it myapp-wordpress bash
```

Stop

```shell
docker-compose stop
```

Down (stop and remove)

```shell
docker-compose down
```

Cleanup

```shell
docker-compose rm -v
```

Recreate

```shell
docker-compose up -d --force-recreate
```

Rebuild docker container when Dockerfile has changed

```shell
docker-compose up -d --force-recreate --build
```
